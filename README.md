### Arrr, welcome aboard, matey! ⊹ ࣪ ﹏𓊝﹏𓂁﹏⊹ ࣪ ˖
#### Ahoy there, bold wanderer, who’s drifted into these digital waters! I am Vincent—a dreamer, a coder, and a seeker of wonders, navigating the boundless seas of creativity and caffeine. Beneath the banner of the poetic muse, I chart courses through verses and stanzas, each one a hidden map leading to treasures of the heart. My quill is my compass, and I’d not trade its ink for all the gold in the fathomless depths. ꒦꒷✎リ
#### When I’m not riding the tides of League of Legends, ye’ll find me mastering the art of combat in versus fighting—every duel a dance of wits, valor, and the thrill of triumph. At other times, I conjure snippets of code like spells from an old grimoire, crafting small wonders simply for the joy of creation. A tiny dreamer I am, forever peering through my spyglass at horizons yet to be discovered.   *ੈ✩‧₊˚  🕹
#### But there’s more to this pirate than the click o’ keys and the clash o’ blades—aye, I’m a poet, too. When the night grows still and the sea whispers secrets to the moon, I take to my quill and parchment, pourin’ my deepest thoughts onto paper soaked with the salt o’ my tears. Each word be a fragment o’ my soul, each verse a map to treasures buried deep within.  ⋆.˚ ☾ .⭒˚
#### And did I mention? I am learning Chinese—a new tongue, a new melody to chart fresh horizons, expanding my arsenal of words for uncharted lands and stories untold. For what is life if not a journey to understand the myriad voices of the world? *ੈ𑁍༘⋆

#### By day, I am a shadow, lost to the waking world. A night owl I remain, prowling the starlit hours like a vampire, feasting on fizzy brews and chicken morsels fit for a pirate’s hearty appetite. 𓅷

### So, brave soul, join me if ye dare! Together, we’ll unravel mysteries, craft legends, write verses, and revel in the mischief of the moment. Arrr, savvy? ⋆༺𓆩☠︎︎𓆪༻⋆

# Catch ye later, ye scaly sea gator! 𓆌
