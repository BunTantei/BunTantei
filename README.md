## (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ About Me

> "By the moon’s pale light, I craft verses and code, where shadows dance and thoughts unfold."

I'm a developer who walks the line between logic and artistry. When I'm not weaving code into existence, you may find me:

- ☆彡 Penning verses beneath starlit skies
- ⌨️ Immersed in digital realms of adventure
- 〆 Contemplating the echoes of ancient philosophy
- 己 Etching hanzi one stroke at a time
- ❄ Reveling in the hushed whispers of winter’s breath
- (´･ω･`) Nursing a cup of tea (or the ever-faithful soda) while taming errant bugs
